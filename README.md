# Introduction
### What is Container Cloud Desktop
Container Cloud Desktop is an innovative virtualization technology that allows users to access and manage their desktop environment through a cloud platform. No matter where they are, as long as they have an Internet connection, users can securely connect to their personal or work desktop from any device for a consistent usage experience. Container cloud desktops support multiple operating systems, are easy to scale, and offer powerful data protection capabilities, making them ideal for remote working and digital transformation.
The Container cloud desktop system takes full advantage of container virtualization technology to provide efficient and scalable desktop solutions through lightweight container instances. Containers have significant advantages over traditional virtual machines in terms of startup time, resource consumption, and system isolation. Container cloud Desktop leverages these benefits to provide users with a responsive, easy-to-manage desktop environment. In addition, the administrator can directly manage resources such as cloud desktop instances, volume instances, network instances, and images of users, greatly simplifying desktop maintenance and management.
Features of this application
### This application has the following features
* Make full use of Docker container virtualization technology: Make full use of Docker container virtualization technology to provide tenants with a stable and reliable cloud desktop environment. Docker's flexibility and lightweight nature allows us to quickly deploy, scale, and manage users' desktop environments while ensuring high application availability and performance stability.
* Plug-in system support: In order to meet the needs of different system administrators, we provide a flexible plug-in system. System administrators can develop and integrate various plug-ins according to their needs to extend the functions of the container cloud desktop platform. This allows system administrators to customize and optimize the cloud desktop platform according to their own workflow and business needs, making their cloud desktop platform more flexible and personalized.
* Efficient design based on Spring Boot framework: This application is designed using Java's Spring Boot framework to ensure its efficiency and reliability. Spring Boot framework simplifies the development process and improves the response speed and performance of the system. With the support of Spring Boot, we can provide users with stable and efficient container cloud desktop services to meet their various work and application needs.

```
where:
* The `spring.datasource` section shows the connection Settings for the backend database of the application, specifically:
  * The default url is the MySQL database. The format of the URL is the default configuration file. `192.168.117.20:3306` indicates the IP address and port number of the database host, and cloud indicates the database name. `autoReconnect=true` indicates automatic reconnect. Please do not change other parts if there is no special requirement
  * `username` specifies the username of the database. It can be passed as an environment variable
  * `password` indicates the password of the database. It can be passed in the form of environment variables
* The `jwt` section indicates the Settings of the JWT (Java Web Token) used for token validation, specifically:
